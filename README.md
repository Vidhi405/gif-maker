# gif-maker
All thanks to Sonny Li from Codedex for this small code.

This small code makes a gif for you by taking images as a input. 
Still developing some more features such as making gifs out of videos and making the image input as user interface.
This is just for reference. I'll keep Sonny's code in this repository, and will add my own files of what changes I have made to them.


## Requirements

python3
imageio library

for imageio library, simply do "pip install imageio" and you'll be set.

Please keep the images in the same file location as your code for the code to execute!
